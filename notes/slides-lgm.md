use https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/

some help: http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/creating-stunning-visualizations-with-impress-js/

- start with the original "ceci n'est pas une pipe" (or maybe use a fake by using a clipart from openclipart?)
- move to banksy's "ceci est une pipe"
- show a scribus screenshot? is it a pipe?
- tell that while creating the epub plugin for scribus i had some doubts, if this is the good way to go
- show phatch? is this a pipe?
- show a huge ls -lh | vim - (or somthing else short, bus useful): this is for sure a pipe!
- show a complex xml file: can we base modern pipes on this?
