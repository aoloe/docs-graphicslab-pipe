- [terminology](http://www.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=about/terminology&l=en), a graphical terminal.
- termkit: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/137kd9/18_months_ago_termkit_a_nextgeneration_terminal/

but, at the end, the question is, wether we really need a terminal... or simply something that comes from the window manager world like dwm or awesome. some sort of tiny window manager with a pipe glue that let the "tiles" communicate.

- FWIW, the ppa is hannes-janetzek/enlightment-svn, and you can try it out in Ubuntu with:

      sudo apt-add-repository ppa:hannes-janetzek/enlightment-svn
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install terminology

  great effort coming along. I'm sticking with terminator for now but will keep my eye on terminolog.
